    <h3>We'll start with the term “asana” which is part of most of the Sanskrit pose names.
       “Asana” is defined as any of the yogic postures or movements, but literally translates to “seat.”
       It's said that originally the only posture in yoga was a comfortable seat taken for long periods of mediation.</h3>
